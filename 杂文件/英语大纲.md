	天生失聪；现高二但是比我大一岁，因为在小时候没有这样的学校，没有学上；喜欢画画，想考长春美术学院；

细节：在交流的过程中，语言没有成为阻碍，两颗心灵贴在一起，彼此好奇着对方的一切。

问题：有人问，我们这样去特教的意义在哪里？我们并没有修改根本的东西，他们依然只有有限的社会资源，依然得不到足够的关注，我们只是在枝桠而非枝干上修建。well，这个问题不是现在回答的，而应该在清水里泡一泡，在盐水里呛一呛，血水里滚一滚，10年后我们再来看。

I would like to present a story in special education center,which is about a boy I met there.

he is born blind and now in senior two.however,because in the past there was no such a school that can provide a suitable education for him,he had no choice but to go to school several years later than normal people did.And now he is a year older than me.

He likes painting,and just like all the art students,he has a very good painting skill.here are some draws he showed to me.when I asked him which university he wants to go to,he said 长春Academy of Arts.

In the progress of communication,the difference between our languages didn’t become a barrier.and in the contrast,a tacit silence replaced words.Two hearts stuck tightly and both of them were curious about each other.in that day we talked a lot

well,someone may ask where the meaning of this story lies in?there are still limited social resourses for them and most of them still keep silent.All the things we did may just build on branches,not roots.

Well,at least for me,I know that outside of our lives,those silent people still live hard with dreams,and the question itself, shouldn’t be answered now.it should soak in clear water,choke in salt water,and roll in blood,then let’s see it again 10 years later.

tacit 心照不宣的

Academy of Arts 美术学院

born deaf 天生失聪

become a barrier 成为障碍

build on branches,not roots 在枝叶而非根部修剪

soak in the clear water,choke in the salt water and roll in the blood,let’s see it again in 10 years.

清水里泡一泡，盐水里呛一呛，血水里滚一滚，10年后我们再来看
